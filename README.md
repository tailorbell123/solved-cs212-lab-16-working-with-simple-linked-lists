Working with simple linked lists.

Create a Project for Lab 16 in Eclipse

Import the three files in the Z:Lab16 directory (ListNode, LinkedList and Lab16Main).

Open all the files, read through Lab16Main and run the application Lab16Main.

Notice it doesnâ€™t do anything because the methods append and prepend are empty in the Class LinkedList.
